                <h2> Algerian Tourist Visa Application</h2> 
                <br>
                <p> Before traveling to Algeria you will be required to apply for an Algeria tourist visa. 
                 We recommend you apply at least 2-3 months before your departure date so that you will get your visa and passport back
                 in time before your trip.<br>
                     
                 Please follow the tourist visa and application guidelines at the consulate website of your country of residence.
                 On the website, you will find the application forms and a detailed list of all documents and fees required to apply for the Algerian tourist visa. 
                 Among the documents needed for the visa application, is the invitation letter from a local travel agency or hotel booking, which we will provide. 
                 If you have any questions about the application, you can call the consulate at the phone number provided on their website.
                 </p>

                 <h2> What is desert camping like?</h2>
                 <p>An extraordinary and memorable adventure of a life time awaits and part of it is camping under the Saharan stars.
                  Camping is not for everyone but to whome the adventure matters more than the accomodation this one is for you!
                  In this section hopefully we can ease your heart from the unknowns of desert camping and if you have any further questions feel free to contact us. 
                 </p>
                     <br>
 
                 <h3> Personal Hygiene</h3>
                 <p>When camping, you do not need to sacrifice personal hygiene. The tour guides will always be carying enough water for you to freshen up and clean your body. However make sure to bring
                 plenty of toilet paper and wet wipes for your own comfort.</p>
                 
                     
                     <br>
 
                 <h3> Sleeping Arrangements</h3>
                 <p>Desert sleeping arrangements vary. Some tour operators build traditional “lean-to” type structures: a three-sided group tent.
                 Others offer European 2-person tents. Mattresses are typically provided. We recommend to bring your own sleeping bag and pillow.</p>
                     
                     <br>
 
                 <h3>Food</h3>
                 <p>No need to worry about the food as the tour guides will cook for you traditional meals such as couscous, lamb, dates, salads, soup, around the fire with some delicious tea.
                 if you have any dietary restritions, please let us know ahead of time.</p>
                     
                     <br>
 
                 <h3> Transportation</h3>
                 <p>Local agents will offer a variety of transportation options. On some location you will take tours by camel, which is a unique experience.
                 On the other locations, the by far most popular and efficient means is a four-wheel drive which is also equipped with all necessary
                 equipement one might need in an adventure across the desert.</p>
