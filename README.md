 ### Known Bugs

  * The video background takes 1.9s to load and even longer with slow connection

  * The gallery loaded really slowly so i compressed all the photos including the video background.
  * The video background didnt play in mobile chrome and Safari so the attribute *playsinline* has been added to the video tag
  * The bullet list item showed next to the footer icons in small screens so it was fixed by adjusting the media queries for small screens
  * Navigation bar and the logo touched in small screens. Fixed by grouping them in one div and then adjusted the size in the media queries
  * A logo subtitle was used at first but to maintain a minimalistic design in small screens as well, it has been removed
