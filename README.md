 ## Design Choices

 ### Wireframes

 ### Video Background: 

 The dramatic video background is set on autoplay looped and muted. It is a daring design choice meant to immerse the user in the desert and spark a sense of adventure and wonder in them. The idea behind this particular video background is that the user is sitting in that moving vehicle looking ahead at this extraordinary Mars-like scene, envisioning the exploration journey they are about to embark in and chooses to play start. It is also used as a marketing hook, letting this scene draw the client in. The clean minimalistic design helps to not distract the user from booking the roatrip package. As the user gradually recieves more information, the video -background is still there as a constant reminder of what awaits them once they choose to book the trip.

### Colors

* The colors chosen are sample colors from the video background to maintain a minimal aesthetic which highlights the earthy colors of the desert. 
* An accent warm orange color similar to the Tardart sand was chosen as a hover effect to mirror the sand dunes but also the color of the buildings in the sahara region. 
* The text color is a dark grey inspired by the dark volcanic rock found in the Hoggar mountains to fit the desert theme and keep the minimalistic easthetic of the website. 

### Images

* In the gallery the images are displayed in two columns responsively 
* the images are displayed on a white background wrapper, with low opacity ,floating on top of a paused video-background to focus the eye of the user on the images
* ..............

### Icons

* Icons are taken from the Fontawesome Icon library and used in the <i> tag provided by Fontaesome.
* They are styles in dark grey or a bright orange depending on the hover function
* Icons with minimal design are also used in the footer as social media account icons.
* Some of the icons are nested in an <a> tag and used as links
